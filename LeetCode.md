## Trie
1. Implement Trie (Prefix Tree) - insert, search, startsWithPrefix
- Node[] children; boolean eow;
2. Word Break 
- Question: Break the word into multiple parts and check whether all parts are present in the dictionary
- Solution: 1. Reverse DP with dp[i] = dp[i + w.length()] 2. Trie insert, search and recursion helper for dividing string 
3. Count Unique Substrings / Count Trie Nodes
- Solution: 1. HashSet with Nested loops to get a substring 2. Trie insert and count nodes
4. Longest word with all prefixes / Longest Word in Dictionary
- Solution: 1. HashSet contains its prefix of (length - 1) 2. Trie inserts and builds a string with it's all prefixes present in the dictionary along with recursion and backtracking
## Graph
1. Connected and Dis connected Graph - BFS (Using Queue) and DFS (Using Recursion)
