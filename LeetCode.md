## Trie
1. Implement Trie (Prefix Tree) - insert, search, startsWithPrefix
- Node[] children; boolean eow;
2. Word Break 
- Question: Break the word into multiple parts and check whether all parts are present in the dictionary
- Solution: 1. Reverse DP with dp[i] = dp[i + w.length()] 2. Trie insert, search and recursion helper for dividing string 
3. Count Unique Substrings / Count Trie Nodes
- Solution: 1. HashSet with Nested loops to get a substring 2. Trie insert and count nodes
4. Longest word with all prefixes / Longest Word in Dictionary
- Solution: 1. HashSet contains its prefix of (length - 1) 2. Trie inserts and builds a string with it's all prefixes present in the dictionary along with recursion and backtracking
## Graph - Time:O(V+E) Space:O(V)
1. Connected and Disconnected Graph - BFS (Using Queue) and DFS (Using Recursion) along with the visited boolean array
2. All Paths From Source to Target
- Solution: 1. DFS with Backtracking (As per the question nodes are to be visited multiple times, so the visited array is not required and backtracking will handle this list.remove(list.size() - 1))
3. Cycle Detection - Directed Graph
- Solution: 1. DFS recursion with the boolean stack and visited array
4. Cycle Detection - Undirected Graph
- Solution: 1. DFS recursion with parent element and visited array
5. Topological Sort - DAG
- Question: Directed Acyclic Graph(DAG) with no cycle (Not for non-DAGs). It's a linear order of vertices u->v (Dependency)
- Solution: 1. DFS recursion with Stack
6. Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm (Shortest Distance) - O(E+ElogV)
- Question: Applicable only for a positive weight and its Greedy Algorithm
- Solution: 1. BFS with Priority Queue as Pair(node, distance) and distance array initialize with Integer.MAX for all nodes except the source with relaxation condition dist[u] + edge.weight < dist[v] then dist[v] = dist[u] + edge.weight (u-current and v-neighbor node)
7. Bellman Ford Algorithm (Shortest Distance) - O(E.V) More than Dijktra's 
- Question: The shortest distance for -ve weights and without a cycle. DP Algorithm - Perform relaxation in the loop V-1 times.
  Detect -ve weight cycle by running nested i and j loop code again
- Solution: 1. It's just a V-1 times loop and another i and j loop for relaxation with Dist array. (NO DFS/BFS/Visited array)
8. Minimum Spanning Tree / Minimum Weight Spanning Tree (MST)
- Question: Sub-Graph with all vertices with minimum possible total edge weight without any cycle. All vertices are connected. A graph has multiple spanning trees, but it has an MST (Undirected Weighted Graph)
9. Prim's Algorithm (MST)
- Solution:
